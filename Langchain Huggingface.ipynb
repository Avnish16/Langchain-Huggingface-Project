Build Your Online Business with E-commerce\\n\\nFrom local shop owners to huge businesses, everyone is looking to create a presence in the online business world. The future of e-commerce can be considered to be bright, and the best time to enter the domain is now!\\n\\n27/06/2023\\n\\nEarning opportunities across the globe have been increasing at a tremendous pace, given the drastic advancement in technology. Since there is no gender, status, or major geographical barriers to most of these, online business as a sector has grown to become one of the many income avenues for people across the globe. Naturally, this growth has spread to India too, which is fairly evident from the \\n\\npast decade.\\n\\nE-commerce is an easy-to-launch and suitable-for-most business idea, which has gained the attention of entrepreneurs of all ages in the country. From local shop owners to huge organizations, everyone is looking to create a presence in the online business world. The future of e-commerce can be considered to be bright, and the best time to enter the domain is \\n\\nnow!\\n\\nBut if you are new to the e-commerce space then, getting started with the basics can get slightly difficult. So lets us start with the most obvious question you may have in mind-\\n\\nWhat is an Ecommerce?\\n\\nE-commerce, put simply, is the practice of buying and selling goods or services using the Internet. It has gained immense popularity as a way of doing business because it\\'s convenient and accessible at the same time. Instead of a physical store where the products to be sold are generally displayed, e-commerce businesses have virtual storefronts where customers can browse and purchase products or services online itself.\\n\\nTo start an e-commerce business, you need an online platform that offers a smooth shopping experience for your customers. This could mean setting up an entirely new business or transforming an existing physical store into a digital platform for trade.\\n\\nMake sure that your website is easy to navigate, and has a secure payment system that allows customers to pay for their orders online. Alternatively, you can go for existing marketplaces like Amazon that have an existing user base and the necessary tools to help your business generate sales. These marketplaces are popular among the customers and are often what entrepreneurs turn to since they essentially provide a ready-made platform to sell products with ease.\\n\\nStill unclear about the whole concept? Let us try to make it easier by looking at an example:\\n\\nRitika wants to sell handmade sweaters online. She\\'ll need to create a website that showcases her products and provides customers with clear information about what they\\'re buying.\\n\\nOnce her website is up and running, she can use various digital marketing techniques such as search engine optimization, social media advertising, or email campaigns to attract customers. And the best part? She can do almost everything from the comfort of her home!\\n\\nOne of the positive impacts of e-commerce on business is that the order fulfillment process is automated. This means that entrepreneurs like Ritika can focus on managing inventory, handling customer queries, analyzing sales data, etc. to make informed decisions to scale the business further.\\n\\nEcommerce Business Vs Traditional Business models\\n\\nWhile the traditional bricks and mortar business model is still relevant, e-commerce has become a preferred choice for conducting business for many sellers across India. Here are some of the points that differentiate e-commerce from the traditional, making it a better fit for the social media-driven generation of consumers.\\n\\nTraditional Businesses\\n\\nE-commerce Businesses\\n\\nRequires a physical office/workplace/storefront\\n\\nNo physical office required, can work from anywhere\\n\\nOwner may need to follow a schedule\\n\\nOwner may need to follow a schedule\\n\\nThe reach of a traditional business is generally limited to customers residing within its neighbouring areas\\n\\nIn most cases, no geographical barriers. Products can be purchased from virtually anywhere in the world.\\n\\nThese are some notable advantages that may persuade a huge chunk of aspiring entrepreneurs to enter the e-commerce industry and build successful businesses.\\n\\nNow that you know why an e-commerce business could be a great way of earning income, let us move on to the next most commonly asked question:\\n\\nCan I Start An E-commerce Business Right Now?\\n\\nThe answer is you absolutely can! You may create your own website or register on an existing marketplace. Starting an online business, thanks to the variety of marketplaces available today, is as easy as it gets. But there are two things that any aspiring entrepreneur like you may wonder about, and we shall cover those exact two points here.\\n\\nCriteria for Starting an Online Business\\n\\nOne of the best parts of owning an online business is that there is no need for a particular educational degree, prior experience, or high investment to get started. It allows people of all regions and genders to generate income by selling /offering products or services respectively.\\n\\nWhile it may be difficult for a minor(below the age of 18) to start an online business, they too can actualize their idea with the help of their guardians making the field virtually open to anyone and everyone in the country.\\n\\nRequirements for Starting an Online Business\\n\\nStarting a brick-and-mortar business can be a task, and may require significant upfront investment, long-term leases, and a range of fixed and constantly changing costs. These include renting or buying a physical location, setting up utilities and equipment, etc.\\n\\nThese costs could quickly add up, and make it challenging for small business owners to enter the market. On the other hand, starting an e-commerce business has fewer requirements, making it a more accessible option for entrepreneurs. All you need to get started is a computer or mobile device, a reliable internet connection, and the products or services you plan to sell.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t get easier than this!\\n\\nSteps to Start an E-commerce Business on an online marketplace\\n\\nThe e-commerce industry is constantly evolving, with newer trends and categories of products being introduced often. However, there are some basic steps that need to be acted on by every entrepreneur with care if they wish to launch a successful e-commerce business. Read on and follow the steps mentioned below if this is exactly what you are looking to do as a potential seller.\\n\\nStep 1 - Decide the Nature of your Business\\n\\nThe first step of starting any business is to come up with a potentially profitable business idea. Consider your skillset, and choose a business that you believe you will be able to ace. Selling goods and services online may sound simple, but a seller with more knowledge about whatever they are selling to their customers shall always have an edge over others.\\n\\nStep 2 - Choose a Marketplace\\n\\nA marketplace is essentially, where you shall set up your online store. These options will potentially give you access to a massive customer base, tools for growing your business, and services that can help you in building a relationship with your customers. While it is also an option for sellers to consider creating a website of their own, a majority choose to set up shop on marketplaces like \\n\\nAmazon, which offers a readymade marketplace for sellers to launch their businesses on.\\n\\nStep 3 - Register with the Marketplace\\n\\nOnce you have decided on the marketplace you wish to build your business on, it is time to create an account on the marketplace. Most marketplaces like Amazon have a very easy sign-up process, which makes registering as a seller a simple task altogether. Make sure that you follow the instructions exactly as mentioned on the website of whichever marketplace you choose. Keep your documents handy, since you may be required to provide some personal information like your name, bank details, etc.\\n\\nStep 4 - Create A Product Listing\\n\\nNow is the time to finally start setting up your online store. Once you have registered with a marketplace, start listing your products category-wise. Make sure that every product you list has sufficient information for the buyer to get a clear idea of what they are potentially purchasing. A clean and informative product listing will appeal to your customers, which will result in better sales.\\n\\nStep 5 - Set Prices\\n\\nDetermining the price range of your products can be slightly tricky, as you are likely to be surrounded by other sellers with competitive prices. For such instances, features like the Automate Pricing Tool by Amazon can come in handy. This tool allows you to automatically adjust prices on your products for different purposes on the Amazon marketplace.\\n\\nYou don’t have to revisit your products each time you want to change the price. All you need to do is set your pricing rule once and go worry-free, the tool will take care of the rest. You can read more about the \\n\\nAutomate Pricing Tool here .\\n\\nEither way, pricing your product correctly can help you grow your business at a much quicker pace. So, make sure that all your products have a reasonable price tag attached to them while setting prices.\\n\\nStep 6 - Have a Marketing Strategy in Mind\\n\\nGenerating sales is only possible if your potential customers find your business first. The only viable way of doing this is good marketing. Creating an effective marketing strategy for an e-commerce business is inexpensive, but all about leveraging the right tools, such as social media. A launch strategy is always an excellent idea, but you can also devise a great post-launch marketing strategy before the launch to consistently see growth in the flow of customers.\\n\\nStep 7 - Launch Successfully\\n\\nOnce all these steps are in place, it is time to launch your business officially. Irrespective of your expected response, make sure to keep your inventory up and ready to go as soon as you launch your business. Remember, first impressions last forever!\\n\\nStarting an e-commerce business can be a profitable and rewarding venture. With the introduction of online businesses as an easy and accessible way of earning money, more entrepreneurs are likely to enter the industry, which means that the sector is set to grow rapidly in the coming years.\\n\\nWe hope that this guide provided some valuable information that can help you build your own business and become a successful entrepreneur too. So what are you waiting for? Get your business idea started, set your e-commerce store up, and start selling now!\\n\\nDisclaimer: Whilst Amazon Seller Services Private Limited (\"Amazon\") has used reasonable endeavours in compiling the information provided, Amazon provides no assurance as to its accuracy, completeness or usefulness or that such information is error-free.

Here are some ways to find great product ideas to sell online.\\n\\nRead Article\\n\\nIn 2023, retail ecommerce sales accounted for over 19% of overall retail sales worldwide, and Statista predicts that, by 2027, ecommerce will make up nearly a quarter of total global retail sales. Needless to say, ecommerce is on the rise.\\n\\nBut what is ecommerce exactly?\\n\\nEcommerce is the process of buying and selling products or services online. Short for “electronic commerce,” ecommerce encompasses all buying and selling that’s done on any digital device or platform, such as an online store, smartphone, online marketplace, or social media platform.\\n\\nWhether it’s business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), or business-to-consumer-business, (B2C2B), or physical or digital products, these online exchanges can come in many forms and occur across a variety of channels.\\n\\nTo fully understand ecommerce, let’s take a look at its history, growth, and impact on the business world. We’ll also touch on the main types of ecommerce business models, the potential benefits and challenges of selling online, and what tools you’ll need to get started.\\n\\nTypes of ecommerce business models\\n\\nGenerally, there are seven main models of ecommerce that businesses can be categorized into, each catering to different audiences and types of transactions. Let’s review each type in more detail.\\n\\nBusiness-to-Consumer (B2C).\\n\\nOne of the most popular sales models in ecommerce, B2C ecommerce involves transactions made between a business and a consumer. For example, when you buy shoes from an online retailer, it’s a B2C ecommerce transaction. Some of the most popular ecommerce businesses today are B2C sellers — think Walmart, Target, or Sephora.\\n\\nBusiness-to-Business (B2B).\\n\\nUnlike B2C, B2B ecommerce encompasses online sales made between businesses, such as a manufacturer and a wholesaler or retailer. B2B is not consumer-facing and happens only between businesses. For example, many popular tech companies — such as Hubspot, Slack, and Microsoft — primarily sell their products and services to other businesses.\\n\\nConsumer-to-Consumer (C2C).\\n\\nOne of the earliest forms of ecommerce, consumer-to-consumer involves the sale of products or services between customers. This can also include any provider that manages a C2C online transaction, such as those seen on eBay or Amazon. A prime example of a C2C sale is when someone uses an online marketplace, such as Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist, to sell a good or service to another person.\\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer (DTC).\\n\\nA newer model of ecommerce, DTC refers to a business that sells products directly to the end customer instead of going through a retailer, distributor, or wholesaler. One common example of D2C ecommerce is a subscription-based brand such as Netflix or Dollar Shave Club.\\n\\nConsumer-to-Business (C2B).\\n\\nC2B flips the traditional retail model on its head, in that individual consumers make their products or services available for business buyers. This could look like a photographer selling stock photos to an ecommerce business like iStock, or an influencer promoting its ecommerce marketing services to a business.\\n\\nBusiness-to-government (B2G)\\n\\nB2A covers the transactions made between online businesses and government entities or public administrations. For example, businesses can sell software related to legal documents or social security to local government agencies.\\n\\nConsumer-to-government (C2G)\\n\\nSimilar to B2G, C2G ecommerce involves consumers selling goods or services to government organizations, and a C2G business is any ecommerce company that facilitates these transactions. For example, utility companies allow home and business owners to make online payments through a government website for energy-related services like electricity or gas. These businesses help foster better communication between consumers and government entities by simplifying payment processes and administrative tasks.\\n\\nSizes of ecommerce businesses\\n\\nFrom small startups to large enterprises, ecommerce businesses can come in all sizes. Let’s look at the main four you’re likely to come across.\\n\\nEnterprise.\\n\\nAn enterprise ecommerce business is a large-scale organization that often has a more complex structure and needs. These businesses tend to offer a much wider range of products and services, as well as serve multiple audiences, including consumers and other businesses.\\n\\nBadgley Mischka, for example, is a sky-rocketing global fashion label serving a wide customer base. Badgley Mischka is sold in some of the most prestigious stores in the world — from the likes of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman to Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom. With that, the brand needed a reliable, scalable ecommerce solution to power its online store — and ultimately chose BigCommerce.\\n\\n“We're breaking our own records month after month,” said Katie Ouaknine, owner of Badgley Mischka Web. “We've increased marketing, and we have a ton of integrations with a lot of your partners that have just made our business and our customers more happy, so we're finding a lot of success.”\\n\\nMid-market.\\n\\nMid-market businesses are exactly what they sound like — in the middle of small, mom-and-pop businesses and big-name enterprises. While there’s no set standard to identify a mid-market company, the size of a business can be measured through metrics such as annual revenue, net income, or number of employees.\\n\\nA great example is Chair King Backyard Store, a Texas-based outdoor furniture retailer. As a large-scale furniture brand, Chair King offers white-glove delivery and localized selling, which meant it needed a customizable checkout experience. Turning to BigCommerce, the furniture brand found the features and functionality to enhance its user experience.\\n\\n“BigCommerce is a better user experience for our customers, and it's also a better user experience for the team that's supporting it,” explained Kristen Brown, Director of Ecommerce for Chair King. “It's definitely pushed us forward even within our space. I think we have one of the more updated websites for the niche market that we're in.”\\n\\nSmall business.\\n\\nSmall businesses are sole proprietorships, partnerships or corporations that sell products or services and make less money and have fewer employees than large multinational corporations. The U.S. Small Business Administration further defines a small business in terms of employment (from 100 to over 1,500 employees) or average annual receipts over time (ranging from $1 million to over $40 million).\\n\\nMoore Brothers Wine Company, for example, is a small business making big moves in the ecommerce space. With BigCommerce powering its commerce engine, the wine company has found the custom functionality to create robust customer experiences online.\\n\\n“Now that we’re on BigCommerce, I can kind of relax a little bit and focus on other things,” said Terry Moore, Operations Manager at Moore Brothers. “Having that integration between all of the data we have and our point of sale database, and having a website that's comfortable and easy to use for our customers, that's terrific.”\\n\\nStartups.\\n\\nA startup is a business or project in the first stages of development, often built by an entrepreneur to pursue an innovative business model. Typically, a startup has less than 100 employees, however startups are often defined not by size but by profitability.\\n\\nMolly Mutt, a company selling high-quality dog beds and crate accessories, is a prime example. With a lean team and a growing business, the brand needed an ecommerce platform that was fully customizable, easy to set up, and could scale with the business.\\n\\n“We've enjoyed developing on BigCommerce because we can customize where we need to, but the base functionality is rock solid so we can always depend on that,” explained Matthew Coles, Account Director at Modelic, Molly Mutt’s agency partner. “But then we still have some freedom to do some interesting workarounds and customizations to make sure that we're servicing the end customer well.”\\n\\nGrowth of ecommerce\\n\\nEcommerce has come a long way since the CompuServe launch in 1969.\\n\\nDriven by changes in technology and global circumstances, ecommerce is growing — and shows no sign of stopping.\\n\\nGlobal internet access and adoption is rapidly increasing, with over five billion internet users worldwide.\\n\\nGlobal retail ecommerce sales are projected to grow by 39% over the coming years, surpassing $8 trillion by 2027.\\n\\nAs of 2023, online marketplaces accounted for the largest share of online purchases worldwide — with Amazon leading the ranks.\\n\\nWhat technology is involved in ecommerce?\\n\\nWhen launching an ecommerce business, you’ll need a core set of tools and systems to ensure basic functionality, such as a robust ecommerce platform, a reliable payment gateway, and an efficient order management system. But as your business grows, you might want to incorporate advanced technologies like customer relationship management (CRM) software, inventory management systems, and marketing automation tools to meet more complex business requirements.\\n\\nIn this section, we’ll dive into the most common technologies that can help you build a successful ecommerce operation.\\n\\nEcommerce platform.\\n\\nAn ecommerce platform is the engine for your online business. Powering the back-end of your tech stack, an ecommerce platform contains the necessary tools to help you build and run your online store, such as payment processing, marketing tools, inventory management, and more.\\n\\nDepending on your business needs and development capabilities, you may choose to host your site on a SaaS platform that provides pre-built, native commerce functionality. Or, you may choose to build your own site from the ground up. Luckily, BigCommerce offers the best of both worlds: the flexibility to create custom, cutting-edge user experiences as well as robust, out-of-the-box functionality.\\n\\nPayment gateways.\\n\\nA payment gateway is an essential functionality for completing online transactions, as it allows your ecommerce site to securely process payments.\\n\\nToday, many customers expect businesses to offer flexible payment options at checkout. In fact, 13% of customers will abandon their carts if they don’t see enough payment methods available.\\n\\nFor many ecommerce businesses, this means offering an array of payment options, such as credit cards, digital wallets like Apple Pay or PayPal, Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), and even cryptocurrency.\\n\\nShipping and fulfillment.\\n\\nShipping and fulfillment are critical components of any ecommerce operation, ensuring that orders are efficiently delivered to customers.\\n\\nWith BigCommerce, merchants can streamline their operations using a comprehensive suite of tools, including real-time shipping quotes, automated order fulfillment, and seamless integration with major carriers like USPS, UPS, and FedEx. This ensures that customers receive their orders quickly and accurately, enhancing their overall shopping experience and driving customer satisfaction.\\n\\nData and analytics.\\n\\nA successful online business leverages data and analytics to gain insights into customer behavior, ecommerce trends, and overall business performance. By deploying advanced analytics tools, businesses can make informed decisions, optimize their strategies, and drive future growth.\\n\\nPoint-of-sale (POS).\\n\\nToday, some of the best ecommerce businesses are the ones that create a seamless shopping journey across all touchpoints — both online and in-store. With a point-of-sale (POS) system, businesses can easily manage in-person transactions and seamlessly integrate orders and inventory between their ecommerce platforms and brick-and-mortar stores, allowing them to provide the unified shopping experience that customers expect.\\n\\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP).\\n\\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) refers to software that automates business processes, from supply chain to customer relationship management (CRM) to — most often — financial systems. ERPs enable organizations to create a single source of truth for their data and connect unrelated APIs to each other for a larger, more cohesive enterprise system.\\n\\nProduct Information Management (PIM).\\n\\nToday’s PIM software collects, manages, enriches and distributes product information across distribution channels, from your ecommerce storefront to social sales channels, marketplaces and even advertising networks.\\n\\nA PIM can become your single source of product truth by acting as a central hub for your product content management, then syncing it across your tech stack — ecommerce platform, ERP, OMS and other third-party integrations.\\n\\nInventory management.\\n\\nWhether you're managing your own inventory or working with a dropshipper, inventory represents a major financial investment — both in its initial cost, and the cost accrued by having to store it. Luckily, inventory management systems track stock levels, track and manage orders, and forecast demand to ensure products are available when customers want them, while also preventing overstocking.\\n\\nBenefits of ecommerce\\n\\nEcommerce has a number of advantages — from faster buying to the ability to reach large audiences 24/7. Let’s take a look in detail at some of the top perks ecommerce has to offer.\\n\\nReach new customers to increase sales.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, ecommerce makes it easier for companies to reach new potential customers. Since your online shop isn’t tied to a single physical storefront, that means it’s open and available to any and all customers who visit it online.\\n\\nWith the added benefits of social media advertising, email marketing, and SEO (search engine optimization), brands also have the potential to connect with massive target audiences who are in a ready-to-buy mindset.\\n\\nScale and streamline operations.\\n\\nEcommerce allows businesses to scale rapidly and streamline operations by automating processes, optimizing inventory management, and leveraging data analytics for informed decision-making. This efficiency enables companies to reach more customers, reduce costs, and improve overall performance.\\n\\nGain customer insights.\\n\\nMany ecommerce platforms offer native marketing tools to gain deep insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends. By analyzing this customer data, businesses can personalize shopping experiences, improve marketing strategies, and build stronger customer relationships, ultimately driving loyalty and growth.\\n\\nSell globally.\\n\\nAs technologies continue to advance and our world becomes ever more interconnected, international expansion will be not just a choice, but a necessity. Luckily, many ecommerce platforms like BigCommerce are already aiding merchants today, both big and small, to expand across borders and scale their businesses exponentially.\\n\\nLow startup costs for small businesses.\\n\\nWithout a need for a physical store (and employees to staff it), ecommerce retailers can launch stores with minimal startup and operating costs. And those that run a dropshipping business can even minimize upfront investment costs.\\n\\nPersonalized shopping experiences.\\n\\nWith the help of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), ecommerce brands can deliver hyper-personalized online experiences for their ecommerce audience. Showcasing relevant products based on past purchase behavior, for example, can lead to higher average order value (AOV) and make the shopper feel like you truly understand their unique needs.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Ecommerce\\n\\nAlthough modern ecommerce is increasingly flexible today, it still has its own setbacks. Here are some of the downsides in more detail.\\n\\nIntegrating with the current tech stack.\\n\\nIf your development team has invested heavily in your existing tech stack, integrating new tools or features can become challenging. However, with BigCommerce's open APIs, businesses can seamlessly plug and play new functionalities, ensuring smooth integration and compatibility with their current systems.\\n\\nCustomer service and returns.\\n\\nFor customers who want to get hands-on with a product (especially in the realm of physical goods like clothing, shoes and beauty products) before adding it to their shopping cart, the ecommerce experience can be limiting.\\n\\nConsistency across channels.\\n\\nWith the growing need for omnichannel commerce, ecommerce businesses face the challenge of creating a consistent user experience across multiple channels. Online brands must cater to customers across social media, mobile apps, online marketplaces, in-store, live chat, and more.\\n\\nCompetition.\\n\\nWith a low barrier of entry comes an increasing number of competitors. To stay ahead, businesses must continuously innovate their marketing strategies to maximize ROI and differentiate themselves in a crowded ecommerce market, ensuring their offerings resonate with target audiences effectively.\\n\\nShipping and fulfillment.\\n\\nDepending on the size of your business and product catalog, managing shipping and fulfillment can be a huge pain point, especially if you’re working with multiple suppliers.\\n\\nData security.\\n\\nAs an ecommerce business, you’ll have a huge responsibility to protect the privacy of your customers. Implementing robust encryption and regular security audits are essential to protect against fraud, cyber threats, and data breaches, ensuring customer trust and compliance with industry standards.\\n\\nUnderstanding international trade and compliance.\\n\\nIf you decide to go into global ecommerce, you’ll need to be able to navigate diverse regulatory landscapes. From data protection laws like GDPR to product safety regulations and taxation requirements, ecommerce businesses must meticulously assess and adhere to various regional regulations.\\n\\nRising consumer expectations.\\n\\nIn the age of same-day shipping and AI chatbots, ecommerce is making shopping more fast, convenient, and accessible than ever — and shoppers expect more and more. As an ecommerce business, you’ll need to be continually in lock step with changing consumer expectations.\\n\\nTechnical issues.\\n\\nIf your ecommerce website is slow, broken or unavailable to customers, this may impact your ability to make sales. Site crashes and technology failures can damage relationships with customers and negatively impact your bottom line.\\n\\nThe history of ecommerce\\n\\nFAQs about ecommerce\\n\\nWhat is ecommerce?\\n\\nWhat are examples of successful ecommerce sites?\\n\\nIs ecommerce growing?\\n\\nBrowse additional resources\\n\\nProduct\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nServices\\n\\nEnterprise Pricing\\n\\nRequest a Demo\\n\\nPartners\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nBecome a Partner\\n\\nFind an Agency Partner\\n\\nFind a Technology Partner\\n\\nAffiliates\\n\\nPowered by\\n\\nCustomers\\n\\nCase Studies\\n\\nStore Examples\\n\\nResources\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nArticles\\n\\nGuides & White Papers\\n\\nWebinars\\n\\nPodcast\\n\\nReports\\n\\nEvents\\n\\nEcommerce Blog\\n\\nDeveloper Blog\\n\\nFree Tools\\n\\nUse case solutions\\n\\nMulti-Storefront\\n\\nHeadless Commerce\\n\\nB2B\\n\\nWholesale\\n\\nOmnichannel\\n\\nInternational\\n\\nCommerce-as-a-Service\\n\\nEmerging Brands\\n\\nSmall Business\\n\\nEnterprise\\n\\nCrypto\\n\\nMigration\\n\\nIndustry solutions\\n\\nFashion & Apparel\\n\\nHealth & Beauty\\n\\nFood & Beverage\\n\\nManufacturing\\n\\nAutomotive\\n\\nCBD\\n\\nHome & Garden\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nLeaders\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nPress\\n\\nAwards\\n\\nInvestor Relations\\n\\nPlatform Trust Center\\n\\nTerms of Service\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nHelp center\\n\\nBigCommerce Community\\n\\nKnowledge Base\\n\\nVideos\\n\\nContact Tech Support\\n\\nDeveloper Center\\n\\nAPI Documentation\\n\\nTheme Documentation\\n\\nX\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\nInstagram\\n\\n© Copyright 2003 - 2024 BigCommerce Pty.

E-commerce draws on technologies such as\\n\\nmobile commerce,\\n\\nelectronic funds transfer,\\n\\nsupply chain management,\\n\\nInternet marketing,\\n\\nonline transaction processing,\\n\\nelectronic data interchange (EDI),\\n\\ninventory management systems, and automated\\n\\ndata collection systems. E-commerce is the largest sector of the\\n\\nelectronics industry and is in turn driven by the technological advances of the\\n\\nsemiconductor industry.\\n\\nDefining e-commerce\\n\\nThe term was coined and first employed by Robert Jacobson, Principal Consultant to the California State Assembly\\'s Utilities & Commerce Committee, in the title and text of California\\'s Electronic Commerce Act, carried by the late Committee Chairwoman Gwen Moore (D-L.A.) and enacted in 1984.\\n\\nE-commerce typically uses the web for at least a part of a transaction\\'s life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail. Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of products (such as books from Amazon) or services (such as music downloads in the form of digital distribution such as the iTunes Store).[1] There are three areas of e-commerce: online retailing, electronic markets, and online auctions. E-commerce is supported by electronic business.[2] The existence value of e-commerce is to allow consumers to shop online and pay online through the Internet, saving the time and space of customers and enterprises, greatly improving transaction efficiency, especially for busy office workers, and also saving a lot of valuable time.[3]\\n\\nE-commerce businesses may also employ some or all of the following:\\n\\nOnline shopping for retail sales direct to consumers via web sites and mobile apps, conversational commerce via live chat, chatbots, and voice assistants.[4]\\n\\nProviding or participating in online marketplaces, which process third-party business-to-consumer (B2C) or consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sales;\\n\\nBusiness-to-business (B2B) buying and selling.[5]\\n\\nGathering and using demographic data through web contacts and social media.\\n\\nB2B electronic data interchange.\\n\\nMarketing to prospective and established customers by e-mail or fax (for example, with newsletters).\\n\\nEngaging in pretail for launching new products and services.\\n\\nOnline financial exchanges for currency exchanges or trading purposes.\\n\\nThere are five essential categories of E-commerce:[6]\\n\\nBusiness to Business\\n\\nBusiness to Consumer\\n\\nBusiness to Government\\n\\nConsumer to Business\\n\\nConsumer to Consumer\\n\\nForms\\n\\nContemporary electronic commerce can be classified into two categories. The first category is business based on types of goods sold (involves everything from ordering \"digital\" content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to \"meta\" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce). The second category is based on the nature of the participant (B2B, B2C, C2B and C2C).[7]\\n\\nOn the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. Data integrity and security are pressing issues for electronic commerce.\\n\\nAside from traditional e-commerce, the terms m-Commerce (mobile commerce) as well (around 2013) t-Commerce[8] have also been used.\\n\\nGovernmental regulation\\n\\nIn the United States, California\\'s Electronic Commerce Act (1984), enacted by the Legislature, the more recent California Privacy Rights Act (2020), enacted through a popular election proposition and to control specifically how electronic commerce may be conducted in California. In the US in its entirety, electronic commerce activities are regulated more broadly by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer privacy. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The Federal Trade Commission Act regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.[9] Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers\\' personal information.[10] As a result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.\\n\\nThe Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the Controlled Substances Act to address online pharmacies.[11]\\n\\nConflict of laws in cyberspace is a major hurdle for harmonization of legal framework for e-commerce around the world. In order to give a uniformity to e-commerce law around the world, many countries adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996).[12]\\n\\nInternationally there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came Econsumer.gov, an ICPEN initiative since April 2001. It is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.\\n\\nThere is also Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. APEC was established in 1989 with the vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity for the region through free and open trade and investment. APEC has an Electronic Commerce Steering Group as well as working on common privacy regulations throughout the APEC region.\\n\\nIn Australia, trade is covered under Australian Treasury Guidelines for electronic commerce and the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission[13] regulates and offers advice on how to deal with businesses online,[14] and offers specific advice on what happens if things go wrong.[15]\\n\\nThe European Union undertook an extensive enquiry into e-commerce in 2015-16 which observed significant growth in the development of e-commerce, along with some developments which raised concerns, such as increased use of selective distribution systems, which allow manufacturers to control routes to market, and \"increased use of contractual restrictions to better control product distribution\". The European Commission felt that some emerging practices might be justified if they could improve the quality of product distribution, but \"others may unduly prevent consumers from benefiting from greater product choice and lower prices in e-commerce and therefore warrant Commission action\" in order to promote compliance with EU competition rules.[16]\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Financial Services Authority (FSA)[17] was formerly the regulating authority for most aspects of the EU\\'s Payment Services Directive (PSD), until its replacement in 2013 by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority.[18] The UK implemented the PSD through the Payment Services Regulations 2009 (PSRs), which came into effect on 1 November 2009. The PSR affects firms providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc. The PSRs created a new class of regulated firms known as payment institutions (PIs), who are subject to prudential requirements. Article 87 of the PSD requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of the PSD by 1 November 2012.[19]\\n\\nIn India, the Information Technology Act 2000 governs the basic applicability of e-commerce.\\n\\nIn China, the Telecommunications Regulations of the People\\'s Republic of China (promulgated on 25 September 2000), stipulated the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as the government department regulating all telecommunications related activities, including electronic commerce.[20] On the same day, the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services were released, the first administrative regulations to address profit-generating activities conducted through the Internet, and lay the foundation for future regulations governing e-commerce in China.[21] On 28 August 2004, the eleventh session of the tenth NPC Standing Committee adopted an Electronic Signature Law, which regulates data message, electronic signature authentication and legal liability issues. It is considered the first law in China\\'s e-commerce legislation. It was a milestone in the course of improving China\\'s electronic commerce legislation, and also marks the entering of China\\'s rapid development stage for electronic commerce legislation.[22]\\n\\nGlobal trends\\n\\nE-commerce has become an important tool for small and large businesses worldwide, not only to sell to customers, but also to engage them.[23][24]\\n\\nCross-border e-Commerce is also an essential field for e-Commerce businesses. \\xa0It has responded to the trend of globalization. It shows that numerous firms have opened up new businesses, expanded new markets, and overcome trade barriers; more and more enterprises have started exploring the cross-border cooperation field. In addition, compared with traditional cross-border trade, the information on cross-border e-commerce is more concealed. In the era of globalization, cross-border e-commerce for inter-firm companies means the activities, interactions, or social relations of two or more e-commerce enterprises. However, the success of cross-border e-commerce promotes the development of small and medium-sized firms, and it has finally become a new transaction mode. It has helped the companies solve financial problems and realize the reasonable allocation of resources field. SMEs ( small and medium enterprises) can also precisely match the demand and supply in the market, having the industrial chain majorization and creating more revenues for companies.[25]\\n\\nIn 2012, e-commerce sales topped $1 trillion for the first time in history.[26]\\n\\nMobile devices are playing an increasing role in the mix of e-commerce, this is also commonly called mobile commerce, or m-commerce. In 2014, one estimate saw purchases made on mobile devices making up 25% of the market by 2017.[27]\\n\\nFor traditional businesses, one research stated that information technology and cross-border e-commerce is a good opportunity for the rapid development and growth of enterprises. Many companies have invested an enormous volume of investment in mobile applications. The DeLone and McLean Model stated that three perspectives contribute to a successful e-business: information system quality, service quality and users\\' satisfaction.[28] There is no limit of time and space, there are more opportunities to reach out to customers around the world, and to cut down unnecessary intermediate links, thereby reducing the cost price, and can benefit from one on one large customer data analysis, to achieve a high degree of personal customization strategic plan, in order to fully enhance the core competitiveness of the products in the company.[29]\\n\\nModern 3D graphics technologies, such as Facebook 3D Posts, are considered by some social media marketers and advertisers as a preferable way to promote consumer goods than static photos, and some brands like Sony are already paving the way for augmented reality commerce. Wayfair now lets you inspect a 3D version of its furniture in a home setting before buying.[30]\\n\\nChina\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nE-commerce in China\\n\\nAmong emerging economies, China\\'s e-commerce presence continues to expand every year. With 668 million Internet users, China\\'s online shopping sales reached $253 billion in the first half of 2015, accounting for 10% of total Chinese consumer retail sales in that period.[31] The Chinese retailers have been able to help consumers feel more comfortable shopping online.[32] e-commerce transactions between China and other countries increased 32% to 2.3 trillion yuan ($375.8 billion) in 2012 and accounted for 9.6% of China\\'s total international trade.[33] In 2013, Alibaba had an e-commerce market share of 80% in China.[34] In 2014, Alibaba still dominated the B2B marketplace in China with a market share of 44.82%, followed by several other companies including Made-in-China.com at 3.21%, and GlobalSources.com at 2.98%, with the total transaction value of China\\'s B2B market exceeding 4.5 billion yuan.[35] In 2014, there were 600 million Internet users in China (twice as many as in the US), making it the world\\'s biggest online market.[36]\\n\\nChina is also the largest e-commerce market in the world by value of sales, with an estimated US$899 billion in 2016.[37] It accounted for 42.4% of worldwide retail e-commerce in that year, the most of any country.[38]:\\u200a110\\u200a Research shows that Chinese consumer motivations are different enough from Western audiences to require unique e-commerce app designs instead of simply porting Western apps into the Chinese market.[39]\\n\\nThe expansion of e-commerce in China has resulted in the development of Taobao villages, clusters of e-commerce businesses operating in rural areas.[38]:\\u200a112\\u200a Because Taobao villages have increased the incomes or rural people and entrepreneurship in rural China, Taobao villages have become a component of rural revitalization strategies.[40]:\\u200a278\\n\\nIn 2015, the State Council promoted the Internet Plus initiative, a five-year plan to integrate traditional manufacturing and service industries with big data, cloud computing, and Internet of things technology.[41]:\\u200a44\\u200a The State Council provided support for Internet Plus through policy support in area including cross-border e-commerce and rural e-commerce.[41]:\\u200a44\\n\\nIn 2019, the city of Hangzhou established a pilot program artificial intelligence-based Internet Court to adjudicate disputes related to e-commerce and internet-related intellectual property claims.[42]:\\u200a124\\n\\nEurope\\n\\nIn 2010, the United Kingdom had the highest per capita e-commerce spending in the world.[43] As of 2013, the Czech Republic was the European country where e-commerce delivers the biggest contribution to the enterprises\\' total revenue. Almost a quarter (24%) of the country\\'s total turnover is generated via the online channel.[44]\\n\\nArab states\\n\\nThe rate of growth of the number of internet users in the Arab countries has been rapid – 13.1% in 2015. A significant portion of the e-commerce market in the Middle East comprises people in the 30–34 year age group. Egypt has the largest number of internet users in the region, followed by Saudi Arabia and Morocco; these constitute 3/4th of the region\\'s share. Yet, internet penetration is low: 35% in Egypt and 65% in Saudi Arabia.[45]\\n\\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council countries have a rapidly growing market and are characterized by a population that becomes wealthier (Yuldashev). As such, retailers have launched Arabic-language websites as a means to target this population. Secondly, there are predictions of increased mobile purchases and an expanding internet audience (Yuldashev). The growth and development of the two aspects make the GCC countries become larger players in the electronic commerce market with time progress. Specifically, research shows that the e-commerce market is expected to grow to over $20 billion by 2020 among these GCC countries (Yuldashev). The e-commerce market has also gained much popularity among western countries, and in particular Europe and the U.S. These countries have been highly characterized by consumer-packaged goods (CPG) (Geisler, 34). However, trends show that there are future signs of a reverse. Similar to the GCC countries, there has been increased purchase of goods and services in online channels rather than offline channels. Activist investors are trying hard to consolidate and slash their overall cost and the governments in western countries continue to impose more regulation on CPG manufacturers (Geisler, 36). In these senses, CPG investors are being forced to adapt to e-commerce as it is effective as well as a means for them to thrive.\\n\\nThe future trends in the GCC countries will be similar to that of the western countries. Despite the forces that push business to adapt e-commerce as a means to sell goods and products, the manner in which customers make purchases is similar in countries from these two regions. For instance, there has been an increased usage of smartphones which comes in conjunction with an increase in the overall internet audience from the regions. Yuldashev writes that consumers are scaling up to more modern technology that allows for mobile marketing.\\nHowever, the percentage of smartphone and internet users who make online purchases is expected to vary in the first few years. It will be independent on the willingness of the people to adopt this new trend (The Statistics Portal). For example, UAE has the greatest smartphone penetration of 73.8 per cent and has 91.9 per cent of its population has access to the internet. On the other hand, smartphone penetration in Europe has been reported to be at 64.7 per cent (The Statistics Portal). Regardless, the disparity in percentage between these regions is expected to level out in future because e-commerce technology is expected to grow to allow for more users.\\n\\nThe e-commerce business within these two regions will result in competition. Government bodies at the country level will enhance their measures and strategies to ensure sustainability and consumer protection (Krings, et al.). These increased measures will raise the environmental and social standards in the countries, factors that will determine the success of the e-commerce market in these countries. For example, an adoption of tough sanctions will make it difficult for companies to enter the e-commerce market while lenient sanctions will allow ease of companies. As such, the future trends between GCC countries and the Western countries will be independent of these sanctions (Krings, et al.). These countries need to make rational conclusions in coming up with effective sanctions.\\n\\nIndia\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nE-commerce in India\\n\\nIndia has an Internet user base of about 460 million as of December 2017.[46] Despite being the third largest user base in the world, the penetration of the Internet is low compared to markets like the United States, United Kingdom or France but is growing at a much faster rate, adding around six million new entrants every month.[citation needed] In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail activities.[47][citation needed] The India retail market is expected to rise from 2.5% in 2016 to 5% in 2020.[48]\\n\\nBrazil\\n\\nIn 2013, Brazil\\'s e-commerce was growing quickly with retail e-commerce sales expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2014. By 2016, eMarketer expected retail e-commerce sales in Brazil to reach $17.3 billion.[49]\\n\\nLogistics\\n\\nLogistics in e-commerce mainly concerns fulfillment. Online markets and retailers have to find the best possible way to fill orders and deliver products. Small companies usually control their own logistic operation because they do not have the ability to hire an outside company. Most large companies hire a fulfillment service that takes care of a company\\'s logistic needs.[50] The optimization of logistics processes that contains long-term investment in an efficient storage infrastructure system and adoption of inventory management strategies is crucial to prioritize customer satisfaction throughout the entire process, from order placement to final delivery. [51]\\n\\nImpacts\\n\\nImpact on markets and retailers\\n\\nToys R Us in Deptford, New Jersey. Despite investments, the chain struggled to win market share in the age of digital commerce.\\n\\nE-commerce markets are growing at noticeable rates. The online market is expected to grow by 56% in 2015–2020. In 2017, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted to 2.3 trillion US dollars and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 4.891 trillion US dollars in 2021.[52] Traditional markets are only expected 2% growth during the same time. Brick and mortar retailers are struggling because of online retailer\\'s ability to offer lower prices and higher efficiency. Many larger retailers are able to maintain a presence offline and online by linking physical and online offerings.[53]\\n\\nE-commerce allows customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase products anytime and from anywhere. Online and traditional markets have different strategies for conducting business. Traditional retailers offer fewer assortment of products because of shelf space where, online retailers often hold no inventory but send customer orders directly to the manufacturer. The pricing strategies are also different for traditional and online retailers. Traditional retailers base their prices on store traffic and the cost to keep inventory. Online retailers base prices on the speed of delivery.\\n\\nThere are two ways for marketers to conduct business through e-commerce: fully online or online along with a brick and mortar store. Online marketers can offer lower prices, greater product selection, and high efficiency rates. Many customers prefer online markets if the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price. However, online retailers cannot offer the physical experience that traditional retailers can. It can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience, which may cause customers to experience product or seller uncertainty. Another issue regarding the online market is concerns about the security of online transactions. Many customers remain loyal to well-known retailers because of this issue.[54]\\n\\nSecurity is a primary problem for e-commerce in developed and developing countries. E-commerce security is protecting businesses\\' websites and customers from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. The type of threats include: malicious codes, unwanted programs (ad ware, spyware), phishing, hacking, and cyber vandalism. E-commerce websites use different tools to avert security threats. These tools include firewalls, encryption software, digital certificates, and passwords.[citation needed]\\n\\nImpact on supply chain management\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSupply chain management\\n\\nFor a long time, companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits. However, the emergence of e-commerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies.[55]\\n\\nE-commerce has the capability to integrate all inter-company and intra-company functions, meaning that the three flows (physical flow, financial flow and information flow) of the supply chain could be also affected by e-commerce. The affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies. For the information flows, e-commerce optimized the capacity of information processing than companies used to have, and for the financial flows, e-commerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions.[55]\\n\\nIn addition, e-commerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains: Firstly, the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions; Secondly, as a result of e-commerce emergence, new capabilities such implementing ERP systems, like SAP ERP, Xero, or Megaventory, have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers. Yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited. Thirdly, technology companies would keep investing on new e-commerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return. Fourthly, e-commerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with, such as political barriers or cross-country changes. Finally, e-commerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain.[55]\\n\\nImpact on employment\\n\\nE-commerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services, software app and digital products. It also causes job losses. The areas with the greatest predicted job-loss are retail, postal, and travel agencies. The development of e-commerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information, customer demands, and production processes. In contrast, people with poor technical skills cannot enjoy the wages welfare. On the other hand, because e-commerce requires sufficient stocks that could be delivered to customers in time, the warehouse becomes an important element. Warehouse needs more staff to manage, supervise and organize, thus the condition of warehouse environment will be concerned by employees.[56]\\n\\nImpact on customers\\n\\nE-commerce brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse websites online, especially for buying products which are not sold in nearby shops. It could help customers buy a wider range of products and save customers\\' time. Consumers also gain power through online shopping. They are able to research products and compare prices among retailers. Thanks to the practice of user-generated ratings and reviews from companies like Bazaarvoice, Trustpilot, and Yelp, customers can also see what other people think of a product, and decide before buying if they want to spend money on it.[57][58] Also, online shopping often provides sales promotion or discounts code, thus it is more price effective for customers. Moreover, e-commerce provides products\\' detailed information; even the in-store staff cannot offer such detailed explanation. Customers can also review and track the order history online.\\n\\nE-commerce technologies cut transaction costs by allowing both manufactures and consumers to skip through the intermediaries. This is achieved through by extending the search area best price deals and by group purchase. The success of e-commerce in urban and regional levels depend on how the local firms and consumers have adopted to e-commerce.[59]\\n\\nHowever, e-commerce lacks human interaction for customers, especially who prefer face-to-face connection. Customers are also concerned with the security of online transactions and tend to remain loyal to well-known retailers. In recent years, clothing retailers such as Tommy Hilfiger have started adding Virtual Fit platforms to their e-commerce sites to reduce the risk of customers buying the wrong sized clothes, although these vary greatly in their fit for purpose.[60] When the customer regret the purchase of a product, it involves returning goods and refunding process. This process is inconvenient as customers need to pack and post the goods. If the products are expensive, large or fragile, it refers to safety issues.[53]\\n\\nImpact on the environment\\n\\nIn 2018, E-commerce generated 1.3\\xa0million short tons (1.2 megatonnes) of container cardboard in North America, an increase from 1.1\\xa0million (1.00)) in 2017. Only 35 percent of North American cardboard manufacturing capacity is from recycled content. The recycling rate in Europe is 80 percent and Asia is 93 percent. Amazon, the largest user of boxes, has a strategy to cut back on packing material and has reduced packaging material used by 19 percent by weight since 2016. Amazon is requiring retailers to manufacture their product packaging in a way that does not require additional shipping packaging. Amazon also has an 85-person team researching ways to reduce and improve their packaging and shipping materials.[61]\\n\\nAccelerated movement of packages around the world includes accelerated movement of living things, with all its attendant risks.[62] Weeds, pests, and diseases all sometimes travel in packages of seeds.[62] Some of these packages are part of brushing manipulation of e-commerce reviews.[62]\\n\\nImpact on traditional retail\\n\\nE-commerce has been cited as a major force for the failure of major U.S. retailers in a trend frequently referred to as a \"retail apocalypse.\"[63] The rise of e-commerce outlets like Amazon has made it harder for traditional retailers to attract customers to their stores and forced companies to change their sales strategies. Many companies have turned to sales promotions and increased digital efforts to lure shoppers while shutting down brick-and-mortar locations.[64] The trend has forced some traditional retailers to shutter its brick and mortar operations.[65]\\n\\nE-commerce during COVID-19\\n\\nFurther information: \\n\\nEconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\nIn March 2020, global retail website traffic hit 14.3 billion visits[66] signifying an unprecedented growth of e-commerce during the lockdown of 2020. Later studies show that online sales increased by 25% and online grocery shopping increased by over 100% during the crisis in the United States.[67] Meanwhile, as many as 29% of surveyed shoppers state that they will never go back to shopping in person again; in the UK, 43% of consumers state that they expect to keep on shopping the same way even after the lockdown is over.[68]\\n\\nRetail sales of e-commerce shows that COVID-19 has a significant impact on e-commerce and its sales are expected to reach $6.5 trillion by 2023.[69]\\n\\nBusiness application\\n\\nautomated online assistant on a merchandising website\\n\\nSome common applications related to electronic commerce are:\\n\\nB2B e-commerce (business-to-business)\\n\\nB2C e-commerce (business-to-consumer)\\n\\nConversational commerce: e-commerce via chat\\n\\nDigital Wallet\\n\\nDocument automation in supply chain and logistics\\n\\nElectronic tickets\\n\\nEnterprise content management\\n\\nGroup buying\\n\\nInstant messaging\\n\\nInternet security\\n\\nOnline auction\\n\\nOnline banking\\n\\nOnline office suites\\n\\nOnline shopping and order tracking\\n\\nOnline transaction processing\\n\\nPretail\\n\\nPrint on demand\\n\\nShopping cart software\\n\\nSocial networking\\n\\nTeleconference\\n\\nUsenet newsgroup\\n\\nVirtual assistant\\n\\nDomestic and international payment systems\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nA timeline for the development of e-commerce:\\n\\n1971 or 1972: The ARPANET is used to arrange a cannabis sale between students at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, later described as \"the seminal act of e-commerce\" in John Markoff\\'s book What the Dormouse Said.[70]\\n\\n1979: Michael Aldrich demonstrates the first online shopping system.[71]\\n\\n1981: Thomson Holidays UK is the first business-to-business (B2B) online shopping system to be installed.[72]\\n\\n1982: Minitel was introduced nationwide in France by France Télécom and used for online ordering.\\n\\n1983: California State Assembly holds first hearing on \"electronic commerce\" in Volcano, California.[73] Testifying are CPUC, MCI Mail, Prodigy, CompuServe, Volcano Telephone, and Pacific Telesis.

Build Your Online Business with E-commerce\\nFrom local shop owners to huge businesses, everyone is looking to create a presence in the online business world. The future of e-commerce can be considered to be bright, and the best time to enter the domain is now!\\n27/06/2023\\nEarning opportunities across the globe have been increasing at a tremendous pace, given the drastic advancement in technology. Since there is no gender, status, or major geographical barriers to most of these, online business as a sector has grown to become one of the many income avenues for people across the globe. Naturally, this growth has spread to India too, which is fairly evident from the \\npast decade.\\nE-commerce is an easy-to-launch and suitable-for-most business idea, which has gained the attention of entrepreneurs of all ages in the country. From local shop owners to huge organizations, everyone is looking to create a presence in the online business world. The future of e-commerce can be considered to be bright, and the best time to enter the domain is \\nnow!\\nBut if you are new to the e-commerce space then, getting started with the basics can get slightly difficult. So lets us start with the most obvious question you may have in mind-\\nWhat is an Ecommerce?\\nE-commerce, put simply, is the practice of buying and selling goods or services using the Internet. It has gained immense popularity as a way of doing business because it's convenient and accessible at the same time. Instead of a physical store where the products to be sold are generally displayed, e-commerce businesses have virtual storefronts where customers can browse and purchase products or services online itself.\\nTo start an e-commerce business, you need an online platform that offers a smooth shopping experience for your customers. This could mean setting up an entirely new business or transforming an existing physical store into a digital platform for trade.\\nMake sure that your website is easy to navigate, and has a secure payment system that allows customers to pay for their orders online. Alternatively, you can go for existing marketplaces like Amazon that have an existing user base and the necessary tools to help your business generate sales. These marketplaces are popular among the customers and are often what entrepreneurs turn to since they essentially provide a ready-made platform to sell products with ease.\\nStill unclear about the whole concept? Let us try to make it easier by looking at an example:\\nRitika wants to sell handmade sweaters online. She'll need to create a website that showcases her products and provides customers with clear information about what they're buying.\\nOnce her website is up and running, she can use various digital marketing techniques such as search engine optimization, social media advertising, or email campaigns to attract customers. And the best part? She can do almost everything from the comfort of her home!\\nOne of the positive impacts of e-commerce on business is that the order fulfillment process is automated. This means that entrepreneurs like Ritika can focus on managing inventory, handling customer queries, analyzing sales data, etc. to make informed decisions to scale the business further.\\nEcommerce Business Vs Traditional Business models\"),\n",

This means that entrepreneurs like Ritika can focus on managing inventory, handling customer queries, analyzing sales data, etc. to make informed decisions to scale the business further.\\nEcommerce Business Vs Traditional Business models\\nWhile the traditional bricks and mortar business model is still relevant, e-commerce has become a preferred choice for conducting business for many sellers across India. Here are some of the points that differentiate e-commerce from the traditional, making it a better fit for the social media-driven generation of consumers.\\nTraditional Businesses\\nE-commerce Businesses\\nRequires a physical office/workplace/storefront\\nNo physical office required, can work from anywhere\\nOwner may need to follow a schedule\\nOwner may need to follow a schedule\\nThe reach of a traditional business is generally limited to customers residing within its neighbouring areas\\nIn most cases, no geographical barriers. Products can be purchased from virtually anywhere in the world.\\nThese are some notable advantages that may persuade a huge chunk of aspiring entrepreneurs to enter the e-commerce industry and build successful businesses.\\nNow that you know why an e-commerce business could be a great way of earning income, let us move on to the next most commonly asked question:\\nCan I Start An E-commerce Business Right Now?\\nThe answer is you absolutely can! You may create your own website or register on an existing marketplace. Starting an online business, thanks to the variety of marketplaces available today, is as easy as it gets. But there are two things that any aspiring entrepreneur like you may wonder about, and we shall cover those exact two points here.\\nCriteria for Starting an Online Business\\nOne of the best parts of owning an online business is that there is no need for a particular educational degree, prior experience, or high investment to get started. It allows people of all regions and genders to generate income by selling /offering products or services respectively.\\nWhile it may be difficult for a minor(below the age of 18) to start an online business, they too can actualize their idea with the help of their guardians making the field virtually open to anyone and everyone in the country.\\nRequirements for Starting an Online Business\\nStarting a brick-and-mortar business can be a task, and may require significant upfront investment, long-term leases, and a range of fixed and constantly changing costs. These include renting or buying a physical location, setting up utilities and equipment, etc.\\nThese costs could quickly add up, and make it challenging for small business owners to enter the market. On the other hand, starting an e-commerce business has fewer requirements, making it a more accessible option for entrepreneurs. All you need to get started is a computer or mobile device, a reliable internet connection, and the products or services you plan to sell.\\nIt doesn't get easier than this!\\nSteps to Start an E-commerce Business on an online marketplace\\nThe e-commerce industry is constantly evolving, with newer trends and categories of products being introduced often. However, there are some basic steps that need to be acted on by every entrepreneur with care if they wish to launch a successful e-commerce business. Read on and follow the steps mentioned below if this is exactly what you are looking to do as a potential seller.\\nStep 1 - Decide the Nature of your Business\\nThe first step of starting any business is to come up with a potentially profitable business idea. Consider your skillset, and choose a business that you believe you will be able to ace. Selling goods and services online may sound simple, but a seller with more knowledge about whatever they are selling to their customers shall always have an edge over others.\\nStep 2 - Choose a Marketplace\"),\n",

These options will potentially give you access to a massive customer base, tools for growing your business, and services that can help you in building a relationship with your customers. While it is also an option for sellers to consider creating a website of their own, a majority choose to set up shop on marketplaces like \\nAmazon, which offers a readymade marketplace for sellers to launch their businesses on.\\nStep 3 - Register with the Marketplace\\nOnce you have decided on the marketplace you wish to build your business on, it is time to create an account on the marketplace. Most marketplaces like Amazon have a very easy sign-up process, which makes registering as a seller a simple task altogether. Make sure that you follow the instructions exactly as mentioned on the website of whichever marketplace you choose. Keep your documents handy, since you may be required to provide some personal information like your name, bank details, etc.\\nStep 4 - Create A Product Listing\\nNow is the time to finally start setting up your online store. Once you have registered with a marketplace, start listing your products category-wise. Make sure that every product you list has sufficient information for the buyer to get a clear idea of what they are potentially purchasing. A clean and informative product listing will appeal to your customers, which will result in better sales.\\nStep 5 - Set Prices\\nDetermining the price range of your products can be slightly tricky, as you are likely to be surrounded by other sellers with competitive prices. For such instances, features like the Automate Pricing Tool by Amazon can come in handy. This tool allows you to automatically adjust prices on your products for different purposes on the Amazon marketplace.\\nYou don’t have to revisit your products each time you want to change the price. All you need to do is set your pricing rule once and go worry-free, the tool will take care of the rest. You can read more about the \\nAutomate Pricing Tool here .\\nEither way, pricing your product correctly can help you grow your business at a much quicker pace. So, make sure that all your products have a reasonable price tag attached to them while setting prices.\\nStep 6 - Have a Marketing Strategy in Mind\\nGenerating sales is only possible if your potential customers find your business first. The only viable way of doing this is good marketing. Creating an effective marketing strategy for an e-commerce business is inexpensive, but all about leveraging the right tools, such as social media. A launch strategy is always an excellent idea, but you can also devise a great post-launch marketing strategy before the launch to consistently see growth in the flow of customers.\\nStep 7 - Launch Successfully\\nOnce all these steps are in place, it is time to launch your business officially. Irrespective of your expected response, make sure to keep your inventory up and ready to go as soon as you launch your business. Remember, first impressions last forever!\\nStarting an e-commerce business can be a profitable and rewarding venture. With the introduction of online businesses as an easy and accessible way of earning money, more entrepreneurs are likely to enter the industry, which means that the sector is set to grow rapidly in the coming years.'),\n",

Here are some ways to find great product ideas to sell online.\\nRead Article\\nIn 2023, retail ecommerce sales accounted for over 19% of overall retail sales worldwide, and Statista predicts that, by 2027, ecommerce will make up nearly a quarter of total global retail sales. Needless to say, ecommerce is on the rise.\\nBut what is ecommerce exactly?\\nEcommerce is the process of buying and selling products or services online. Short for “electronic commerce,” ecommerce encompasses all buying and selling that’s done on any digital device or platform, such as an online store, smartphone, online marketplace, or social media platform.\\nWhether it’s business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), or business-to-consumer-business, (B2C2B), or physical or digital products, these online exchanges can come in many forms and occur across a variety of channels.\\nTo fully understand ecommerce, let’s take a look at its history, growth, and impact on the business world. We’ll also touch on the main types of ecommerce business models, the potential benefits and challenges of selling online, and what tools you’ll need to get started.\\nTypes of ecommerce business models\\nGenerally, there are seven main models of ecommerce that businesses can be categorized into, each catering to different audiences and types of transactions. Let’s review each type in more detail.\\nBusiness-to-Consumer (B2C).\\nOne of the most popular sales models in ecommerce, B2C ecommerce involves transactions made between a business and a consumer. For example, when you buy shoes from an online retailer, it’s a B2C ecommerce transaction. Some of the most popular ecommerce businesses today are B2C sellers — think Walmart, Target, or Sephora.\\nBusiness-to-Business (B2B).\\nUnlike B2C, B2B ecommerce encompasses online sales made between businesses, such as a manufacturer and a wholesaler or retailer. B2B is not consumer-facing and happens only between businesses. For example, many popular tech companies — such as Hubspot, Slack, and Microsoft — primarily sell their products and services to other businesses.\\nConsumer-to-Consumer (C2C).\\nOne of the earliest forms of ecommerce, consumer-to-consumer involves the sale of products or services between customers. This can also include any provider that manages a C2C online transaction, such as those seen on eBay or Amazon. A prime example of a C2C sale is when someone uses an online marketplace, such as Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist, to sell a good or service to another person.\\nDirect-to-Consumer (DTC).\\nA newer model of ecommerce, DTC refers to a business that sells products directly to the end customer instead of going through a retailer, distributor, or wholesaler. One common example of D2C ecommerce is a subscription-based brand such as Netflix or Dollar Shave Club.\\nConsumer-to-Business (C2B).\\nC2B flips the traditional retail model on its head, in that individual consumers make their products or services available for business buyers. This could look like a photographer selling stock photos to an ecommerce business like iStock, or an influencer promoting its ecommerce marketing services to a business.\\nBusiness-to-government (B2G)\\nB2A covers the transactions made between online businesses and government entities or public administrations. For example, businesses can sell software related to legal documents or social security to local government agencies.\\nConsumer-to-government (C2G)\\nSimilar to B2G, C2G ecommerce involves consumers selling goods or services to government organizations, and a C2G business is any ecommerce company that facilitates these transactions. For example, utility companies allow home and business owners to make online payments through a government website for energy-related services like electricity or gas. These businesses help foster better communication between consumers and government entities by simplifying payment processes and administrative tasks.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.bigcommerce.com/articles/ecommerce/'}, page_content=\"Sizes of ecommerce businesses\\nFrom small startups to large enterprises, ecommerce businesses can come in all sizes. Let’s look at the main four you’re likely to come across.\\nEnterprise.\\nAn enterprise ecommerce business is a large-scale organization that often has a more complex structure and needs. These businesses tend to offer a much wider range of products and services, as well as serve multiple audiences, including consumers and other businesses.\\nBadgley Mischka, for example, is a sky-rocketing global fashion label serving a wide customer base. Badgley Mischka is sold in some of the most prestigious stores in the world — from the likes of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman to Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom. With that, the brand needed a reliable, scalable ecommerce solution to power its online store — and ultimately chose BigCommerce.\\n“We're breaking our own records month after month,” said Katie Ouaknine, owner of Badgley Mischka Web. “We've increased marketing, and we have a ton of integrations with a lot of your partners that have just made our business and our customers more happy, so we're finding a lot of success.”\\nMid-market.\\nMid-market businesses are exactly what they sound like — in the middle of small, mom-and-pop businesses and big-name enterprises. While there’s no set standard to identify a mid-market company, the size of a business can be measured through metrics such as annual revenue, net income, or number of employees.\\nA great example is Chair King Backyard Store, a Texas-based outdoor furniture retailer. As a large-scale furniture brand, Chair King offers white-glove delivery and localized selling, which meant it needed a customizable checkout experience. Turning to BigCommerce, the furniture brand found the features and functionality to enhance its user experience.\\n“BigCommerce is a better user experience for our customers, and it's also a better user experience for the team that's supporting it,” explained Kristen Brown, Director of Ecommerce for Chair King. “It's definitely pushed us forward even within our space. I think we have one of the more updated websites for the niche market that we're in.”\\nSmall business.\\nSmall businesses are sole proprietorships, partnerships or corporations that sell products or services and make less money and have fewer employees than large multinational corporations. The U.S. Small Business Administration further defines a small business in terms of employment (from 100 to over 1,500 employees) or average annual receipts over time (ranging from $1 million to over $40 million).\\nMoore Brothers Wine Company, for example, is a small business making big moves in the ecommerce space. With BigCommerce powering its commerce engine, the wine company has found the custom functionality to create robust customer experiences online.\\n“Now that we’re on BigCommerce, I can kind of relax a little bit and focus on other things,” said Terry Moore, Operations Manager at Moore Brothers. “Having that integration between all of the data we have and our point of sale database, and having a website that's comfortable and easy to use for our customers, that's terrific.”\\nStartups.\\nA startup is a business or project in the first stages of development, often built by an entrepreneur to pursue an innovative business model. Typically, a startup has less than 100 employees, however startups are often defined not by size but by profitability.\\nMolly Mutt, a company selling high-quality dog beds and crate accessories, is a prime example. With a lean team and a growing business, the brand needed an ecommerce platform that was fully customizable, easy to set up, and could scale with the business.\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.bigcommerce.com/articles/ecommerce/'}, page_content=\"Molly Mutt, a company selling high-quality dog beds and crate accessories, is a prime example. With a lean team and a growing business, the brand needed an ecommerce platform that was fully customizable, easy to set up, and could scale with the business.\\n“We've enjoyed developing on BigCommerce because we can customize where we need to, but the base functionality is rock solid so we can always depend on that,” explained Matthew Coles, Account Director at Modelic, Molly Mutt’s agency partner. “But then we still have some freedom to do some interesting workarounds and customizations to make sure that we're servicing the end customer well.”\\nGrowth of ecommerce\\nEcommerce has come a long way since the CompuServe launch in 1969.\\nDriven by changes in technology and global circumstances, ecommerce is growing — and shows no sign of stopping.\\nGlobal internet access and adoption is rapidly increasing, with over five billion internet users worldwide.\\nGlobal retail ecommerce sales are projected to grow by 39% over the coming years, surpassing $8 trillion by 2027.\\nAs of 2023, online marketplaces accounted for the largest share of online purchases worldwide — with Amazon leading the ranks.\\nWhat technology is involved in ecommerce?\\nWhen launching an ecommerce business, you’ll need a core set of tools and systems to ensure basic functionality, such as a robust ecommerce platform, a reliable payment gateway, and an efficient order management system. But as your business grows, you might want to incorporate advanced technologies like customer relationship management (CRM) software, inventory management systems, and marketing automation tools to meet more complex business requirements.\\nIn this section, we’ll dive into the most common technologies that can help you build a successful ecommerce operation.\\nEcommerce platform.\\nAn ecommerce platform is the engine for your online business. Powering the back-end of your tech stack, an ecommerce platform contains the necessary tools to help you build and run your online store, such as payment processing, marketing tools, inventory management, and more.\\nDepending on your business needs and development capabilities, you may choose to host your site on a SaaS platform that provides pre-built, native commerce functionality. Or, you may choose to build your own site from the ground up. Luckily, BigCommerce offers the best of both worlds: the flexibility to create custom, cutting-edge user experiences as well as robust, out-of-the-box functionality.\\nPayment gateways.\\nA payment gateway is an essential functionality for completing online transactions, as it allows your ecommerce site to securely process payments.\\nToday, many customers expect businesses to offer flexible payment options at checkout. In fact, 13% of customers will abandon their carts if they don’t see enough payment methods available.\\nFor many ecommerce businesses, this means offering an array of payment options, such as credit cards, digital wallets like Apple Pay or PayPal, Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), and even cryptocurrency.\\nShipping and fulfillment.\\nShipping and fulfillment are critical components of any ecommerce operation, ensuring that orders are efficiently delivered to customers.\\nWith BigCommerce, merchants can streamline their operations using a comprehensive suite of tools, including real-time shipping quotes, automated order fulfillment, and seamless integration with major carriers like USPS, UPS, and FedEx. This ensures that customers receive their orders quickly and accurately, enhancing their overall shopping experience and driving customer satisfaction.\\nData and analytics.\\nA successful online business leverages data and analytics to gain insights into customer behavior, ecommerce trends, and overall business performance. By deploying advanced analytics tools, businesses can make informed decisions, optimize their strategies, and drive future growth.\\nPoint-of-sale (POS).\"),\n",

By deploying advanced analytics tools, businesses can make informed decisions, optimize their strategies, and drive future growth.\\nPoint-of-sale (POS).\\nToday, some of the best ecommerce businesses are the ones that create a seamless shopping journey across all touchpoints — both online and in-store. With a point-of-sale (POS) system, businesses can easily manage in-person transactions and seamlessly integrate orders and inventory between their ecommerce platforms and brick-and-mortar stores, allowing them to provide the unified shopping experience that customers expect.\\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP).\\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) refers to software that automates business processes, from supply chain to customer relationship management (CRM) to — most often — financial systems. ERPs enable organizations to create a single source of truth for their data and connect unrelated APIs to each other for a larger, more cohesive enterprise system.\\nProduct Information Management (PIM).\\nToday’s PIM software collects, manages, enriches and distributes product information across distribution channels, from your ecommerce storefront to social sales channels, marketplaces and even advertising networks.\\nA PIM can become your single source of product truth by acting as a central hub for your product content management, then syncing it across your tech stack — ecommerce platform, ERP, OMS and other third-party integrations.\\nInventory management.\\nWhether you're managing your own inventory or working with a dropshipper, inventory represents a major financial investment — both in its initial cost, and the cost accrued by having to store it. Luckily, inventory management systems track stock levels, track and manage orders, and forecast demand to ensure products are available when customers want them, while also preventing overstocking.\\nBenefits of ecommerce\\nEcommerce has a number of advantages — from faster buying to the ability to reach large audiences 24/7. Let’s take a look in detail at some of the top perks ecommerce has to offer.\\nReach new customers to increase sales.\\nFirst and foremost, ecommerce makes it easier for companies to reach new potential customers. Since your online shop isn’t tied to a single physical storefront, that means it’s open and available to any and all customers who visit it online.\\nWith the added benefits of social media advertising, email marketing, and SEO (search engine optimization), brands also have the potential to connect with massive target audiences who are in a ready-to-buy mindset.\\nScale and streamline operations.\\nEcommerce allows businesses to scale rapidly and streamline operations by automating processes, optimizing inventory management, and leveraging data analytics for informed decision-making. This efficiency enables companies to reach more customers, reduce costs, and improve overall performance.\\nGain customer insights.\\nMany ecommerce platforms offer native marketing tools to gain deep insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends. By analyzing this customer data, businesses can personalize shopping experiences, improve marketing strategies, and build stronger customer relationships, ultimately driving loyalty and growth.\\nSell globally.\\nAs technologies continue to advance and our world becomes ever more interconnected, international expansion will be not just a choice, but a necessity. Luckily, many ecommerce platforms like BigCommerce are already aiding merchants today, both big and small, to expand across borders and scale their businesses exponentially.\\nLow startup costs for small businesses.\"),\n",

Luckily, many ecommerce platforms like BigCommerce are already aiding merchants today, both big and small, to expand across borders and scale their businesses exponentially.\\nLow startup costs for small businesses.\\nWithout a need for a physical store (and employees to staff it), ecommerce retailers can launch stores with minimal startup and operating costs. And those that run a dropshipping business can even minimize upfront investment costs.\\nPersonalized shopping experiences.\\nWith the help of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), ecommerce brands can deliver hyper-personalized online experiences for their ecommerce audience. Showcasing relevant products based on past purchase behavior, for example, can lead to higher average order value (AOV) and make the shopper feel like you truly understand their unique needs.\\nDisadvantages of Ecommerce\\nAlthough modern ecommerce is increasingly flexible today, it still has its own setbacks. Here are some of the downsides in more detail.\\nIntegrating with the current tech stack.\\nIf your development team has invested heavily in your existing tech stack, integrating new tools or features can become challenging. However, with BigCommerce's open APIs, businesses can seamlessly plug and play new functionalities, ensuring smooth integration and compatibility with their current systems.\\nCustomer service and returns.\\nFor customers who want to get hands-on with a product (especially in the realm of physical goods like clothing, shoes and beauty products) before adding it to their shopping cart, the ecommerce experience can be limiting.\\nConsistency across channels.\\nWith the growing need for omnichannel commerce, ecommerce businesses face the challenge of creating a consistent user experience across multiple channels. Online brands must cater to customers across social media, mobile apps, online marketplaces, in-store, live chat, and more.\\nCompetition.\\nWith a low barrier of entry comes an increasing number of competitors. To stay ahead, businesses must continuously innovate their marketing strategies to maximize ROI and differentiate themselves in a crowded ecommerce market, ensuring their offerings resonate with target audiences effectively.\\nShipping and fulfillment.\\nDepending on the size of your business and product catalog, managing shipping and fulfillment can be a huge pain point, especially if you’re working with multiple suppliers.\\nData security.\\nAs an ecommerce business, you’ll have a huge responsibility to protect the privacy of your customers. Implementing robust encryption and regular security audits are essential to protect against fraud, cyber threats, and data breaches, ensuring customer trust and compliance with industry standards.\\nUnderstanding international trade and compliance.\\nIf you decide to go into global ecommerce, you’ll need to be able to navigate diverse regulatory landscapes. From data protection laws like GDPR to product safety regulations and taxation requirements, ecommerce businesses must meticulously assess and adhere to various regional regulations.\\nRising consumer expectations.\\nIn the age of same-day shipping and AI chatbots, ecommerce is making shopping more fast, convenient, and accessible than ever — and shoppers expect more and more. As an ecommerce business, you’ll need to be continually in lock step with changing consumer expectations.\\nTechnical issues.\\nIf your ecommerce website is slow, broken or unavailable to customers, this may impact your ability to make sales. Site crashes and technology failures can damage relationships with customers and negatively impact your bottom line.\\nThe history of ecommerce\\nFAQs about ecommerce\\nWhat is ecommerce?\\nWhat are examples of successful ecommerce sites?\\nIs ecommerce growing?\\nBrowse additional resources\\nProduct\\nFeatures\\nServices\"),\n",

E-commerce is the largest sector of the\\nelectronics industry and is in turn driven by the technological advances of the\\nsemiconductor industry.\\nDefining e-commerce\\nThe term was coined and first employed by Robert Jacobson, Principal Consultant to the California State Assembly's Utilities & Commerce Committee, in the title and text of California's Electronic Commerce Act, carried by the late Committee Chairwoman Gwen Moore (D-L.A.) and enacted in 1984.\\nE-commerce typically uses the web for at least a part of a transaction's life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail. Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of products (such as books from Amazon) or services (such as music downloads in the form of digital distribution such as the iTunes Store).[1] There are three areas of e-commerce: online retailing, electronic markets, and online auctions. E-commerce is supported by electronic business.[2] The existence value of e-commerce is to allow consumers to shop online and pay online through the Internet, saving the time and space of customers and enterprises, greatly improving transaction efficiency, especially for busy office workers, and also saving a lot of valuable time.[3]\\nE-commerce businesses may also employ some or all of the following:\\nOnline shopping for retail sales direct to consumers via web sites and mobile apps, conversational commerce via live chat, chatbots, and voice assistants.[4]\\nProviding or participating in online marketplaces, which process third-party business-to-consumer (B2C) or consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sales;\\nBusiness-to-business (B2B) buying and selling.[5]\\nGathering and using demographic data through web contacts and social media.\\nB2B electronic data interchange.\\nMarketing to prospective and established customers by e-mail or fax (for example, with newsletters).\\nEngaging in pretail for launching new products and services.\\nOnline financial exchanges for currency exchanges or trading purposes.\\nThere are five essential categories of E-commerce:[6]\\nBusiness to Business\"),\n",

The first category is business based on types of goods sold (involves everything from ordering \"digital\" content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to \"meta\" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce). The second category is based on the nature of the participant (B2B, B2C, C2B and C2C).[7]\\nOn the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. Data integrity and security are pressing issues for electronic commerce.\\nAside from traditional e-commerce, the terms m-Commerce (mobile commerce) as well (around 2013) t-Commerce[8] have also been used.\\nGovernmental regulation\\nIn the United States, California\\'s Electronic Commerce Act (1984), enacted by the Legislature, the more recent California Privacy Rights Act (2020), enacted through a popular election proposition and to control specifically how electronic commerce may be conducted in California. In the US in its entirety, electronic commerce activities are regulated more broadly by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer privacy. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The Federal Trade Commission Act regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.[9] Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers\\' personal information.[10] As a result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.\\nThe Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the Controlled Substances Act to address online pharmacies.[11]\\nConflict of laws in cyberspace is a major hurdle for harmonization of legal framework for e-commerce around the world. In order to give a uniformity to e-commerce law around the world, many countries adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996).[12]\\nInternationally there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came Econsumer.gov, an ICPEN initiative since April 2001. It is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.\\nThere is also Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation.

The European Commission felt that some emerging practices might be justified if they could improve the quality of product distribution, but \"others may unduly prevent consumers from benefiting from greater product choice and lower prices in e-commerce and therefore warrant Commission action\" in order to promote compliance with EU competition rules.[16]\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Financial Services Authority (FSA)[17] was formerly the regulating authority for most aspects of the EU\\'s Payment Services Directive (PSD), until its replacement in 2013 by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority.[18] The UK implemented the PSD through the Payment Services Regulations 2009 (PSRs), which came into effect on 1 November 2009. The PSR affects firms providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc. The PSRs created a new class of regulated firms known as payment institutions (PIs), who are subject to prudential requirements. Article 87 of the PSD requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of the PSD by 1 November 2012.[19]\\nIn India, the Information Technology Act 2000 governs the basic applicability of e-commerce.\\nIn China, the Telecommunications Regulations of the People\\'s Republic of China (promulgated on 25 September 2000), stipulated the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as the government department regulating all telecommunications related activities, including electronic commerce.[20] On the same day, the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services were released, the first administrative regulations to address profit-generating activities conducted through the Internet, and lay the foundation for future regulations governing e-commerce in China.[21] On 28 August 2004, the eleventh session of the tenth NPC Standing Committee adopted an Electronic Signature Law, which regulates data message, electronic signature authentication and legal liability issues. It is considered the first law in China\\'s e-commerce legislation. It was a milestone in the course of improving China\\'s electronic commerce legislation, and also marks the entering of China\\'s rapid development stage for electronic commerce legislation.[22]\\nGlobal trends\\nE-commerce has become an important tool for small and large businesses worldwide, not only to sell to customers, but also to engage them.[23][24]'),\n",

It shows that numerous firms have opened up new businesses, expanded new markets, and overcome trade barriers; more and more enterprises have started exploring the cross-border cooperation field. In addition, compared with traditional cross-border trade, the information on cross-border e-commerce is more concealed. In the era of globalization, cross-border e-commerce for inter-firm companies means the activities, interactions, or social relations of two or more e-commerce enterprises. However, the success of cross-border e-commerce promotes the development of small and medium-sized firms, and it has finally become a new transaction mode. It has helped the companies solve financial problems and realize the reasonable allocation of resources field. SMEs ( small and medium enterprises) can also precisely match the demand and supply in the market, having the industrial chain majorization and creating more revenues for companies.[25]\\nIn 2012, e-commerce sales topped $1 trillion for the first time in history.[26]\\nMobile devices are playing an increasing role in the mix of e-commerce, this is also commonly called mobile commerce, or m-commerce. In 2014, one estimate saw purchases made on mobile devices making up 25% of the market by 2017.[27]\\nFor traditional businesses, one research stated that information technology and cross-border e-commerce is a good opportunity for the rapid development and growth of enterprises. Many companies have invested an enormous volume of investment in mobile applications. The DeLone and McLean Model stated that three perspectives contribute to a successful e-business: information system quality, service quality and users' satisfaction.[28] There is no limit of time and space, there are more opportunities to reach out to customers around the world, and to cut down unnecessary intermediate links, thereby reducing the cost price, and can benefit from one on one large customer data analysis, to achieve a high degree of personal customization strategic plan, in order to fully enhance the core competitiveness of the products in the company.[29]\\nModern 3D graphics technologies, such as Facebook 3D Posts, are considered by some social media marketers and advertisers as a preferable way to promote consumer goods than static photos, and some brands like Sony are already paving the way for augmented reality commerce. Wayfair now lets you inspect a 3D version of its furniture in a home setting before buying.[30]\\nChina\\nMain article: \\nE-commerce in China\\nAmong emerging economies, China's e-commerce presence continues to expand every year. With 668 million Internet users, China's online shopping sales reached $253 billion in the first half of 2015, accounting for 10% of total Chinese consumer retail sales in that period.[31] The Chinese retailers have been able to help consumers feel more comfortable shopping online.[32] e-commerce transactions between China and other countries increased 32% to 2.3 trillion yuan ($375.8 billion) in 2012 and accounted for 9.6% of China's total international trade.[33] In 2013, Alibaba had an e-commerce market share of 80% in China.[34] In 2014, Alibaba still dominated the B2B marketplace in China with a market share of 44.82%, followed by several other companies including Made-in-China.com at 3.21%, and GlobalSources.com at 2.98%, with the total transaction value of China's B2B market exceeding 4.5 billion yuan.[35] In 2014, there were 600 million Internet users in China (twice as many as in the US), making it the world's biggest online market.[36]\"),\n",

Almost a quarter (24%) of the country's total turnover is generated via the online channel.[44]\\nArab states\\nThe rate of growth of the number of internet users in the Arab countries has been rapid – 13.1% in 2015. A significant portion of the e-commerce market in the Middle East comprises people in the 30–34 year age group. Egypt has the largest number of internet users in the region, followed by Saudi Arabia and Morocco; these constitute 3/4th of the region's share. Yet, internet penetration is low: 35% in Egypt and 65% in Saudi Arabia.[45]\\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council countries have a rapidly growing market and are characterized by a population that becomes wealthier (Yuldashev). As such, retailers have launched Arabic-language websites as a means to target this population. Secondly, there are predictions of increased mobile purchases and an expanding internet audience (Yuldashev). The growth and development of the two aspects make the GCC countries become larger players in the electronic commerce market with time progress. Specifically, research shows that the e-commerce market is expected to grow to over $20 billion by 2020 among these GCC countries (Yuldashev). The e-commerce market has also gained much popularity among western countries, and in particular Europe and the U.S. These countries have been highly characterized by consumer-packaged goods (CPG) (Geisler, 34). However, trends show that there are future signs of a reverse. Similar to the GCC countries, there has been increased purchase of goods and services in online channels rather than offline channels. Activist investors are trying hard to consolidate and slash their overall cost and the governments in western countries continue to impose more regulation on CPG manufacturers (Geisler, 36). In these senses, CPG investors are being forced to adapt to e-commerce as it is effective as well as a means for them to thrive.\"),\n",

Despite the forces that push business to adapt e-commerce as a means to sell goods and products, the manner in which customers make purchases is similar in countries from these two regions. For instance, there has been an increased usage of smartphones which comes in conjunction with an increase in the overall internet audience from the regions. Yuldashev writes that consumers are scaling up to more modern technology that allows for mobile marketing.\\nHowever, the percentage of smartphone and internet users who make online purchases is expected to vary in the first few years. It will be independent on the willingness of the people to adopt this new trend (The Statistics Portal). For example, UAE has the greatest smartphone penetration of 73.8 per cent and has 91.9 per cent of its population has access to the internet. On the other hand, smartphone penetration in Europe has been reported to be at 64.7 per cent (The Statistics Portal). Regardless, the disparity in percentage between these regions is expected to level out in future because e-commerce technology is expected to grow to allow for more users.\\nThe e-commerce business within these two regions will result in competition. Government bodies at the country level will enhance their measures and strategies to ensure sustainability and consumer protection (Krings, et al.). These increased measures will raise the environmental and social standards in the countries, factors that will determine the success of the e-commerce market in these countries. For example, an adoption of tough sanctions will make it difficult for companies to enter the e-commerce market while lenient sanctions will allow ease of companies. As such, the future trends between GCC countries and the Western countries will be independent of these sanctions (Krings, et al.). These countries need to make rational conclusions in coming up with effective sanctions.\\nIndia\\nMain article: \\nE-commerce in India\\nIndia has an Internet user base of about 460 million as of December 2017.[46] Despite being the third largest user base in the world, the penetration of the Internet is low compared to markets like the United States, United Kingdom or France but is growing at a much faster rate, adding around six million new entrants every month.[citation needed] In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail activities.[47][citation needed] The India retail market is expected to rise from 2.5% in 2016 to 5% in 2020.[48]\\nBrazil\\nIn 2013, Brazil's e-commerce was growing quickly with retail e-commerce sales expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2014. By 2016, eMarketer expected retail e-commerce sales in Brazil to reach $17.3 billion.[49]\\nLogistics\\nLogistics in e-commerce mainly concerns fulfillment. Online markets and retailers have to find the best possible way to fill orders and deliver products. Small companies usually control their own logistic operation because they do not have the ability to hire an outside company. Most large companies hire a fulfillment service that takes care of a company's logistic needs.[50] The optimization of logistics processes that contains long-term investment in an efficient storage infrastructure system and adoption of inventory management strategies is crucial to prioritize customer satisfaction throughout the entire process, from order placement to final delivery.

Despite investments, the chain struggled to win market share in the age of digital commerce.\\nE-commerce markets are growing at noticeable rates. The online market is expected to grow by 56% in 2015–2020. In 2017, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted to 2.3 trillion US dollars and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 4.891 trillion US dollars in 2021.[52] Traditional markets are only expected 2% growth during the same time. Brick and mortar retailers are struggling because of online retailer's ability to offer lower prices and higher efficiency. Many larger retailers are able to maintain a presence offline and online by linking physical and online offerings.[53]\\nE-commerce allows customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase products anytime and from anywhere. Online and traditional markets have different strategies for conducting business. Traditional retailers offer fewer assortment of products because of shelf space where, online retailers often hold no inventory but send customer orders directly to the manufacturer. The pricing strategies are also different for traditional and online retailers. Traditional retailers base their prices on store traffic and the cost to keep inventory. Online retailers base prices on the speed of delivery.\\nThere are two ways for marketers to conduct business through e-commerce: fully online or online along with a brick and mortar store. Online marketers can offer lower prices, greater product selection, and high efficiency rates. Many customers prefer online markets if the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price. However, online retailers cannot offer the physical experience that traditional retailers can. It can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience, which may cause customers to experience product or seller uncertainty. Another issue regarding the online market is concerns about the security of online transactions. Many customers remain loyal to well-known retailers because of this issue.[54]\\nSecurity is a primary problem for e-commerce in developed and developing countries. E-commerce security is protecting businesses' websites and customers from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. The type of threats include: malicious codes, unwanted programs (ad ware, spyware), phishing, hacking, and cyber vandalism. E-commerce websites use different tools to avert security threats. These tools include firewalls, encryption software, digital certificates, and passwords.[citation needed]\\nImpact on supply chain management\\nMain article: \\nSupply chain management\\nFor a long time, companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits. However, the emergence of e-commerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies.[55]\\nE-commerce has the capability to integrate all inter-company and intra-company functions, meaning that the three flows (physical flow, financial flow and information flow) of the supply chain could be also affected by e-commerce. The affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies. For the information flows, e-commerce optimized the capacity of information processing than companies used to have, and for the financial flows, e-commerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions.[55]\"),\n",

Yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited. Thirdly, technology companies would keep investing on new e-commerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return. Fourthly, e-commerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with, such as political barriers or cross-country changes. Finally, e-commerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain.[55]\\nImpact on employment\\nE-commerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services, software app and digital products. It also causes job losses. The areas with the greatest predicted job-loss are retail, postal, and travel agencies. The development of e-commerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information, customer demands, and production processes. In contrast, people with poor technical skills cannot enjoy the wages welfare. On the other hand, because e-commerce requires sufficient stocks that could be delivered to customers in time, the warehouse becomes an important element. Warehouse needs more staff to manage, supervise and organize, thus the condition of warehouse environment will be concerned by employees.[56]\\nImpact on customers\\nE-commerce brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse websites online, especially for buying products which are not sold in nearby shops. It could help customers buy a wider range of products and save customers' time. Consumers also gain power through online shopping. They are able to research products and compare prices among retailers. Thanks to the practice of user-generated ratings and reviews from companies like Bazaarvoice, Trustpilot, and Yelp, customers can also see what other people think of a product, and decide before buying if they want to spend money on it.[57][58] Also, online shopping often provides sales promotion or discounts code, thus it is more price effective for customers. Moreover, e-commerce provides products' detailed information; even the in-store staff cannot offer such detailed explanation. Customers can also review and track the order history online.\\nE-commerce technologies cut transaction costs by allowing both manufactures and consumers to skip through the intermediaries. This is achieved through by extending the search area best price deals and by group purchase. The success of e-commerce in urban and regional levels depend on how the local firms and consumers have adopted to e-commerce.[59]\\nHowever, e-commerce lacks human interaction for customers, especially who prefer face-to-face connection. Customers are also concerned with the security of online transactions and tend to remain loyal to well-known retailers. In recent years, clothing retailers such as Tommy Hilfiger have started adding Virtual Fit platforms to their e-commerce sites to reduce the risk of customers buying the wrong sized clothes, although these vary greatly in their fit for purpose.[60] When the customer regret the purchase of a product, it involves returning goods and refunding process. This process is inconvenient as customers need to pack and post the goods. If the products are expensive, large or fragile, it refers to safety issues.[53]\\nImpact on the environment\"),\n",
